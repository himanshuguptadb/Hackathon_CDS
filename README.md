- Meadlion Architecture
- Bamboolib
  - EDA
  - ETL
  - Feature Engineering
- Feature store 
- AutoML
- MlFlow
- Dashboards

Personas Covered:
- Citizen Data Scientist, who is a business SME, getting into insights from raw data with low 

## Problem Statement
In this excercise, you will use Databricks Lakehouse platform to go through the whole data science pipeline to solve a business problem and predict engine faliure using synthetically generated telematics data. Dataset used in this excercise except weather data is generated using databricks datagen library https://databrickslabs.github.io/dbldatagen/public_docs/APIDOCS.html.

When you have completed this excercise, you will understand how to:

* Use platform to load, visualize, and analyze data
* Use bamboolib UI to perform EDA, ETL and feature engineering
* Use AutoML to quick build and test machine learning algorithm
* Deploy a selected machine learning model to production using UI

## Data Dictionary
Dataset consistes for 400 engines build and sold between January 2022 and September 2022, their telemetry data, corresponding weather infiormation and faliure data
